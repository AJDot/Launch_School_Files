# Name and define the three sublanguages of SQL.

**Data Definition Language**
Controls the rules the data needs to follow and the relationships between the different data. SQL constructs used on this level are `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `ADD`. This is where the schema that control the data formats and relationships are created and altered.

**Data Manipulation Language**
Controls access and alteration of the actual data in the database. SQL constructs used in this sublanguage are `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.

**Data Control Language**
Controls the levels of access each user has to the data. The main SQL construct used here is `GRANT`.
