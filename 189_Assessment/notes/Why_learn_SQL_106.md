# Why learn SQL?

Relational databases provide connections between tables which models their relationships. One perk of this is being able to reduce the amount of duplicate data. For example, a user only needs to be listed once in `user` table and all of his/her products can be listed separately in the `products` table and be linked to each other through the use of a `key`.

Typos are reduced. The few times you have to type a name, the fewer times the name will be typed incorrectly. To update the name of a customer, for example, there is only one place it needs to be changed. With a single table (like in excel), it would have to be changed for every purchase the customer has made.

Proper formatting can be enforced. Relational databases can have rules that prevent the entry of data that is not formatted in a way suitable for the information. For example, a column representing phone numbers can be setup to reject the entry of data that does not follow the form `###-###-####`.
