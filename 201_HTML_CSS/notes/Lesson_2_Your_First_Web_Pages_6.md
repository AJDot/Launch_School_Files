## Summary


### HTML

* HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language.
* HTML uses markup to organize your content and give it semantic meaning.
* Elements are the basic building blocks of HTML.
* We use tags in HTML to represent elements.
* Tags may have attributes that add details to the element.
* The Document Type Definition (DTD) tells the browser what subset of HTML you intend to use.

### CSS

* CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets.
* You can use CSS via the style attribute, the \\<style> tag, or with a \\<link> tag.
* CSS tells your browser how to present content with spacing, colors, sizing, font styles, background images, placement, and much more.
* CSS properties have a name and value.
* CSS rules have a selector that describes what elements to style and a list of zero or more properties that define how the browser should render the elements.
  * CSS tag selectors select HTML elements by element (tag) name, e.g., h1
  * CSS class selectors select HTML elements by class name. The selector consists of a . followed by the class name, e.g., .highlight.
  * CSS ID selectors select HTML elements by ID name. The selector consists of a # followed by the ID, e.g., #intro.
  * You can concatenate CSS selectors to make them more specific, e.g., strong.highlight.
* CSS has both specificity and inheritance rules that control the notion of the cascade; together, these rules define how CSS rules with different selectors interact.
* CSS font stacks tell the browser which font to use by providing a list of candidate fonts along with an optional "fallback" font family.
