# Notes on Challenges
## 3 Skills to Develop
1. problem solving with code
2. refactoring
3. reading code

Programming is always about producing a "draft". There is no such thing as "finished code". Therefore, always consider your first take as a first draft.

## Phases to Writing Code
1. Understanding the problem => First draft
2. Re-think the problem and refactor #1 => Second draft
4. Analyze for performance bottlenecks => Fourth draft
