### 129 Exam Feedback
#### How well do you feel that course 120 prepared you for this assessment?
I felt mostly prepared for this test. I reviewed the OO book, most of the shorter exercises during the course and most of the 120 exercises. In hindsight it looks like I could have used more practice with the concept of using modules as mixins. Aside from this, the other mistakes I made were simply careless; I was prepared to answer them but my fingers didn't follow through.

#### Were the questions clear and unambiguous about what we expect from you?
If I were to pick a question, #7 was rather vague. I answered it to the best of my ability (and it looks like it was satisfactory) but I was not confident in my answer. I know the statements I was making were accurate but I wasn't sure they were answering the question.

#### Were any questions too hard or unexpected? Were any questions too easy?
The first 7 questions were essay-type questions. I didn't expect there to be so many of these. I expected the majority of questions to present some amount code and then ask to demonstrate a concept by modifying or explaining the code; this was the style of the 109 exam. I am not upset or complaining about this but it would have been more helpful if this exam aligned more with the type of questions from 109. My suggestion at this moment would be to incorporate more essay-type questions in 109 so they are not surprising to see on the 129 exam.

Question 8 was too easy. All one has to do is copy/paste the code and add `puts Orca.ancestors` to figure out the method lookup. My suggestion would be to define a `#free` method in a couple locations, such as in `Aquatic` and `Predatory`. Then the answer would just include locations up to the first occurence of `#free`. This would require the student to know when to stop since `Orca.ancestors` would still list every location.

Question 11 was too easy. I think it could have been incorporated into another question. Or maybe the question could have asked to make one getter/setter public, one private, and one protected and then demonstrate when each type would be appropriate to use.

#### Did you have enough time to answer all questions to your satisfaction?
I could have used another 10 min or so.

#### Other
I would have liked to see a question on the difference between `public`, `private`, and `protected` instance methods.

I really liked questions 13, 14, 16.

I am satisfied with the quality of the exam.
