### **120 Object Oriented Programming Feedback**
#### **What I Found Helpful**

#### **What Didn't Work Well For Me**
The first task in this course was to read the _Object Oriented Programming with Ruby_ book. I was a little disappointed in the depth of the book. I am writing this as I finished the book so I not experienced the next part of the course which may alleviate my discomfort with this LS book. I feel the book could have gone at least one or two more exercises deeper at the end of every part; just when the exercises were getting good, they ended.

And what is with the last page in the book? I deduce that this page is the last page a person may see when running through the free material before they officially join Launch School? As this is likely the case, why am I seeing it? Not a crucial problem by any means, but I was confused while reading it until I realized who it was actually meant for.
