# Relational Data and JOINs
## Summary
* *relational databases* are called relational becausethey persist data in a set of *relations*, or, as they are more commonly called, *tables*.
* A *relationshihp* is a connectino between entity instances, or rows of data, usually resulting from a relationshihp between what those rows of data represent.
* The three levels of schema are *conceptual*, *logical*, and *physical*.
* the three types of relationships are *one to one*, *one to many*, and *many to many*.
* A *conceptual schema* is a high-level design focused on identifying entities and their relationships.
* A *physical schema* is a low-level database-specific design focused on implementation.
* *Cardinality* is the number of objects on each side of therelationship.
* The *modality* of a relationshihp indicates if that relationship is required or not.
* *Referential integrity* is a data property that requires every value in one column of a table to appear in a column of (usually) another table.
