## Introduction
### What Are Regular Expressions?
Regex are special strings, known as _patterns_, used to search for text in a string or set of strings. They can be used to:
1. perform conditional tests
2. extrat desired information
3. modify desired information

### What Are Regex Used For?
* Check whether the pattern ss appears in the string `"Mississippi"`.
* Check whether the letter `i` occurs 3 or more times in `"Mississippi"`.
* Find and replace all instances of `"Mrs"` with `"Ms"` in a document.
* Does a file name begin with `"Bob"` and end with `".txt"` or `".md"`?
* Does a string have any non-alphanumeric characters in it?
* Has a valid integer been entered by the user?
* Are there any whitespace characters in the string?
* Find and replace all non-alphanumeric characters in a string with `"-"`.
* Locate all email addresses in a document.
* Split a line of text into fields where each field is marked by one or more whitespace characters.
