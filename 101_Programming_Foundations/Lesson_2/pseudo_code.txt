1. Write a method that returns the sum of two integers.

# INFORMAL

Given two numbers.

Add them together and call it "sum"

Print sum


# FORMAL

START

# Given two numbers num1 and num2

SET sum = num1 + num2

PRINT sum

END


2. Write a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is
all those strings concatenated together.

# INFORMAL

Given an array of strings.

Iterate over the array one by one.
  - Save the first string as the starting value
  - for each iteration add the string to the starting value

After iterating, return the saved value.


# FORMAL

START

# Given as array of strings called "strings"

SET strings_concat = first string in strings
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  SET current_string = value of strings at space "iterator"
  strings_concat += current_string
  iterator += 1

PRINT strings_concat

end


3. Write a method that takes an array of integers and returns a new array with
every other element.

# INFORMAL

Given an array of integers

Create a new array
Iterate over array one by one
  - If the index is even then add it to a new array
  - otherwise do nothing

After iterating, return the new array.


# FORMAL

START

Given an array of integers called "integers"

SET iterator = 0
SET integers_every_other = []

WHILE iterator < length of integers
  SET current_integer = value within integers at space "iterator"

  IF iterator % 2 == 0
    push current_integer to integers_every_other
  ELSE
    do nothing

  iterator += 1

PRINT integers_every_other
