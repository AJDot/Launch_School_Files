# What is RSpec and how is it different from Minitest?

RSpec and Minitest are built to accomplish the same task - automate testing. RSpec differs from Minitest in that it is a __Domain Specific Language__. This means it is coded in such a way that allows the syntax to read better/easier. the underlying capabilities of RSpec vs. Minitest are the same.

In contrast, Minitest is more straight forward and looks basically like regular Ruby code (because it is... so is RSpec).
