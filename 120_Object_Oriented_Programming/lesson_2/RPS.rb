# Step 1
# Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

# - rock beats scissors
# - scissors beats paper
# - paper beats rock

# If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.

# Step 2
# Nouns: player, move, rule
# Verbs: choose, compare

# Step 3

# - choose
# Move
# Rule

# - compare

# Step 4
class Player
  def initialize
    # maybe a "name"? what about a "move"?
  end

  def choose

  end
end

class Move
  def initialize
    # seems like we need something to keep track
    # of the choice... a move object can be "paper", "rock", or "scissors"
  end
end

class Rule
  def initialize
    # not sure what the "state" of a rule object should be
  end
end

# not sure where "compare" goes yet
def compare(move1, move2)
