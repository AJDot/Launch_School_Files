# Step 1
# Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

# - rock beats scissors
# - scissors beats paper
# - paper beats rock

# If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.

# Step 2
# Nouns: player, move, rule
# Verbs: choose, compare

# Step 3
# Player
# - choose
# Move
# Rule

# - compare

# is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?
# what is the primary improvement of this new design?
# what is the primary drawback of this new design?
# => This is a better design because there is less repeated code. The if/else logic before the refactoring was bulky and harder to read than the current code.
# => I'm not sure there is a drawback. Code seems simpler and just as functional. It's easier to read. To instantiate a human player using Human.new, and a computer player using Computer.new, is completely transparent. There is no question as to what is happening.
