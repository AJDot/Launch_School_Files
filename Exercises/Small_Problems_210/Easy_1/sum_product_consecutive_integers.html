      // Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 1 and the entered integer.
      //
      // Examples:
      //
      // Please enter an integer greater than 0: 5
      // Enter "s" to compute the sum, "p" to compute the product. s
      //
      // The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.
      // Please enter an integer greater than 0: 6
      // Enter "s" to compute the sum, "p" to compute the product. p
      //
      // The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.

      // The Problem
      //   Input: Integer greater that 0
      //          'sum' or 'product'
      //   Output: The sum or product of number between 1 and entered number
      //   Rules:
      //     If "s" is entered, computer sum.
      //     If "p" is entered, computer product.

      // Algorithm
      //   prompt number and choice from user. Use while loop to insure choice is a valid choice.
      //   for loop to compute sum or product
      //   log result to console

      var number;
      var choice;

      number = parseInt(prompt('Please enter an integer greater than 0: '));
      while (true) {
        choice = prompt('Enter "s" to computer the sum "p" to computer the product. ');
        if (choice === 's' || choice === 'p') {
          break;
        }

        alert('Invalid choice. Try again.');
      }

      if (choice === 's') {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
          sum += i;
        }
        console.log('The sum of the integers between 1 and ' + number + ' is ' + String(sum) + '.');
      } else {
        var product = 1;
        for (var i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
          product *= i;
        }
        console.log('The product of the integers between 1 and ' + number + ' is ' + String(product) + '.');
