      // Fibonacci Numbers (Procedural)
      //
      // In the previous exercise, we developed a recursive solution to calculating the nth Fibonacci number. In a language that is not optimized for recursion, some (not all) recursive functions can be extremely slow and require massive quantities of memory and/or stack space. If you tested for bigger nth numbers, you may have notice that getting the 50th fibonacci number already takes some time.
      //
      // Fortunately, every recursive function can be rewritten as a non-recursive (procedural) function.
      //
      // Rewrite your recursive fibonacci function so that it computes its results without recursion.

      function fibonacci(nth) {
        var first = 1;
        var second = 1;
        var fib = 1;
        var i;

        if (nth <= 2) { return 1; }

        for (i = 3; i <= nth; i++) {
          first = second;
          second = fib;
          fib = first + second;
        }

        return fib;
      }

      console.log(fibonacci(20));   // 6765
      console.log(fibonacci(50));   // 12586269025
      console.log(fibonacci(100));  // 354224848179261915075
