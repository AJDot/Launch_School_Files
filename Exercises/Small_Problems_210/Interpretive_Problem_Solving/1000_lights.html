      // You have a bank of switches before you, numbered from 1 to n. Each switch is connected to exactly one light that is initially off. You walk down the row of switches, and toggle every one of them. You go back to the beginning, and on this second pass you toggle switches 2, 4, 6, and so on. On the third pass, you go back again to the beginning and toggle switches 3, 6, 9, and so on. You repeat this process and keep going until you have been through n repetitions.

      // Write a program that takes one argument, total number of switches, and returns an array of lights that are on after n repetitions.

      // The Problem
      // Input: Number of lights
      // Output: Array of lights that are on after all iterations
      // Rules:
      //   1. All lights start off.
      //   2. Flipped lights based on the light # being a multiple of the current iteration number. For the nth round, multiples of n will be switched.
      //   3. The number of switches === number of rounds.

      // Data Structures
      // Array of Booleans (or 'on'/'off') states representing a light being on or off.

      // Algorithm
      // Generate Array (lights) of size n (# of lights) all initialized to 'off'.
      // Iterate through lights n times
      //   - flip of each light if (index + 1) % n === 0
      // filter lights to return only lights turned 'on'
      // return filtered result

      function lightsOn(numLights) {
        var result = [];
        var lights = initializeLights(numLights);

        for (var round = 1; round <= numLights; round++) {
          lights = flipLightsOnRound(lights, round);
        }

        lights.forEach(function(light, index) {
          if (light) { result.push(index + 1); }
        });

        return result;
      }

      function initializeLights(n) {
        var lights = [];
        lights.length = n;
        lights.fill(false);
        return lights;
      }

      function flipLightsOnRound(lights, round) {
        return lights.map(function(light, lightIndex) {
          return (lightIndex + 1) % round === 0 ? !light : light;
        });
      }

      console.log(lightsOn(5));       // [1, 4]
      console.log(lightsOn(100));       // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
      console.log(lightsOn(1));       // [1]
      console.log(lightsOn(0));       // []
