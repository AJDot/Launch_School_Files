      // The Fibonacci series is a series of numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) such that the first 2 numbers are 1 by definition, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. This series appears throughout the natural world.
      //
      // Computationally, the Fibonacci series is a simple series, but the results grow at an incredibly rapid rate. For example, the 100th Fibonacci number is 354,224,848,179,261,915,075 -- that's enormous, especially considering that it takes 6 iterations just to find the first 2 digit Fibonacci number.
      //
      // Write a function that calculates and returns the index of the first Fibonacci number that has the number of digits specified as an argument. (The first Fibonacci number has index 1.)

      function findFibonacciIndexByLength(length) {
        var first = 1;
        var second = 1;
        var fib = 0;
        var index = 2;

        while (String(fib).length < length) {
          fib = first + second;
          first = second;
          second = fib;

          index += 1;
        }

        return index;
