      // Transpose MxN

      // In the previous exercise, you wrote a function to transpose a 3 x 3 matrix as represented by an Array of Arrays.
      //
      // Matrix transposes aren't limited to 3 x 3 matrices, or even square matrices. Any matrix can be transposed by simply switching columns with rows.
      //
      // Modify your transpose function from the previous exercise so it works with any matrix with at least 1 row and 1 column.



      // Same solution as for 3x3 matrices solved previously
      function transpose(matrix) {
        var rowCount = matrix.length;
        var newRowCount = matrix[0].length;
        var transposed = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < newRowCount; i++) {
          transposed.push([]);
        }

          for (var col = 0; col < newRowCount; col++) {
            transposed[col].push(matrix[row][col]);
          }
        }

        return transposed;

      console.log(transpose([[1]]));                // [[1]]
      console.log(transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 7, 8, 6, 2]]));
