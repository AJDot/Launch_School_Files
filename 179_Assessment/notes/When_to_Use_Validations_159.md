# When to Use Validations

If the bad data comes from user input on a form, then it should be validated. Provide an error message and allow the users to correct the bad data.

Errors in your program due to a bug should not be validated. The bug should simply be found and fixed.


Messages revealing any details about your code may be used maliciously.
